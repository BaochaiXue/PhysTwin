    \textbf{Applications of our \ourabbr.} Our constructed PhysTwin supports a variety of tasks, including real-time interactive simulation, which can accept input from either a keyboard or a robot teleoperation setup. Meanwhile, PhysTwin also enables model-based robot planning to accomplish tasks such as lifting a rope into some specific configuration. }
