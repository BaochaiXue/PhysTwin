    \textbf{Qualitative Results on Generalization to Unseen Interactions.}
    We visualize the simulation of a deformable object under unseen interactions using our method and GS-Dynamics~\cite{zhang2024dynamic}. The leftmost image shows the interaction used to train the dynamics models, while the images on the right demonstrate their generalization to unseen interactions. Our PhysTwin significantly outperforms prior work.
