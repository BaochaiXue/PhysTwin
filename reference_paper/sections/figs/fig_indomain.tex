    \textbf{Qualitative Results on Reconstruction \& Resimulation and Future Prediction.} We visualize the rendering results of different methods on two tasks. For the reconstruction \& resimulation task, our method achieves a better match with the observations. For the future prediction task, our method accurately predicts the future state of the objects. In contrast, the baselines fail in most cases: GS-Dynamics~\cite{zhang2024dynamic} tends to remain static, while Spring-Gauss~\cite{zhong2024reconstruction} frequently causes the physical model to crash.
