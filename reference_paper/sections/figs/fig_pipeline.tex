    \textbf{Overview of Our \ourabbr Framework.} We present an overview of our PhysTwin framework, where the core representation includes geometry, topology, physical parameters (associated with springs and contacts), and Gaussian kernels. To optimize PhysTwin, we minimize the rendering loss and the discrepancy between simulated and observed geometry/motion. The rendering loss optimizes the Gaussian kernels, while the geometry and motion losses refine the overall geometry, topology, and physical parameters in PhysTwin.
