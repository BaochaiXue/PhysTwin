    \textbf{\ourabbr} takes sparse videos (three camera views) of deformable objects under interaction as input and reconstructs a simulatable digital twin with complete geometry, high-fidelity appearance, and accurate physical parameters. This enables multiple applications, such as real-time interactive simulation using keyboards and robotic teleoperation devices, as well as model-based robot planning.}
