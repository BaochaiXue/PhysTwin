\section{Conclusion}
We introduced PhysTwin, a novel framework for constructing physical digital twins from sparse videos, enabling effective reconstruction and resimulation of deformable objects. Our approach excels in predicting future states and simulating object interactions that generalize to unseen actions. 
We showed the superior performance of our method across various object types, control configurations, and task settings, significantly outperforming prior work. 
\ourabbr enables various downstream tasks that demand high-speed simulation and accurate future prediction. 
Moreover, our approach provides valuable insights for robotic manipulation. By bridging perception and physics-based simulation, \ourabbr serves as a crucial tool for guiding robot interactions, making real-world deployment more efficient and reliable.
